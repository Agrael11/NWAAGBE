# Not Working At All - Gameboy Emulator

This is my custom gameboy emulator made in C#. Emulator currently uses rendering into bitmap, but IF it will ever work,
i will definitely change it.

## What current works (a little)

- Background rendering
- CPU (probably got some instructions implemented wrong)
- Input (probably not working at all)
- Scrolling nintendo logo (yay)
- Memory (should work pretty good)
- MBC1 (should work)
- Some kind of Debugger

## What doesn't work

- Interrupts
- Sound
- Everything else

## Games Status

- Tic Tac Toe boots up
  - It's possible to switch background with A button
  
  Any help welcomed... pleaaase. If you want to, I am open to any suggestion to fixes
